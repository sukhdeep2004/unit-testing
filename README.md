 NUnit Calculator with Advanced Unit Tests

A C# project showcasing unit testing with NUnit.
This repo contains a Calculator service with basic and advanced mathematical operations,
along with a comprehensive NUnit test suite that covers edge cases, exception handling, and floating-point precision.

Project Structure:

NUnitCalculator/
 Calculator/
         Calculate.cs          # Calculator logic
 Calculator.Tests/
         UnitTest1.cs           # NUnit test 

This Project Demonstrates

Solid NUnit practices: [TestFixture], [SetUp], [TestCase], Assert.Throws.

Clean code principles: Separation of concerns (Calculator logic vs. Tests).

Edge-case thinking: Error handling and precision testing.

Portfolio value: Demonstrates real-world testing beyond trivial Add/Subtract.
